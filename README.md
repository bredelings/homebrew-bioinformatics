# Bredelings Bioinformatics

I migrated the only formula here (bali-phy) to `brewscio/bio`.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install bredelings/bioinformatics/<formula>`

Or `brew tap bredelings/bioinformatics` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bredelings/homebrew-bioinformatics/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
